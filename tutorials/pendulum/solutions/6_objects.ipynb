    "\n",
    "For didactic purposes, we initially created two sensors, i.e. one with angle and one with angular velocity measurements.\n",
    "However, we could also have created a sensor that contains both. \n",
    "In fact, in the engine-specific implementation we actually alreade use engine node `x` that extracts the ODE state and outputs that to the two engine nodes `theta` and `theta_dot`.\n",
    "Therefore, as an exercise we will define a new sensor `x`, that will contain both `theta` and `theta_dot` measurements, and the output of engine node `x` to implement that sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1 Add a sensor `x` to the `@register.sensor` decorator with `low=[-999, -999]` and `high=[999, 999]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2 Set the `rate` of sensor `x` to `30`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.3 Connect `x.outputs.observation` to sensor `x` in the engine implementation. You **don't** have to disconnect `theta` and `theta_dot`. By not selecting them when making the parameter specification, eagerx will figure out that these nodes are not needed and will forgo on their initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.4 Replace the currently selected `theta` and `theta_dot` with sensor  `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.5 Instead of connecting `theta` and `theta_dot` as observations `angle` and `angular_velocity` respectively, we will connect `x` as the sole observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.6 Now that we have selected `x` as an observation, modify `PendulumEnv.step()` such that observation `x` is unpacked into `th` and `thdot`. "
