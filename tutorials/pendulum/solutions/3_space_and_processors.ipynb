    "\n",
    "In the code as provided above, we reduced the observation space by normalizing $\\theta$.\n",
    "This will improve the sample efficiency, but we can do even better.\n",
    "Normalizing $\\theta$ results in discontinous observations of $\\theta$, i.e. there is a sign switch increasing the angle over $\\pi$ or decreasing the angle smaller than $-\\pi$.\n",
    "Many (reinforcement) learning algorithms have difficulties with such discontinuities.\n",
    "Therefore it is better to choose a representation for $\\theta$ without discontinuities, e.g. its cosine and sine component: $[\\cos(\\theta), \\sin(\\theta)]$.\n",

    "### Add your code to the following blocks: \n",
    "\n",
    "1.1 Instead of the normalized angle, the `convert` method should return the decomposed angle: $[\\cos(\\theta), \\sin(\\theta)]$.  \n",
    "1.2 The bounds (`low`, `high`) and `shape`  of the space of `theta` should be updated accordingly.  \n",
    "1.3 The `step()` mehtod should be updated as well. Reconstruct $\\theta$, since it is no longer observed directly by the agent.  "
