    "# Tutorial 1: Environment Creation and Training\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will show a simple example of how to create a gym environment using [EAGERx](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/).\n",
    "Also, we will use this environment to train a policy using [Stable Baselines 3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this tutorial is to show some of the key concepts of EAGERx:\n",
