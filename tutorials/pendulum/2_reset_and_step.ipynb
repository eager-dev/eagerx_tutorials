    "# Tutorial 2: Reset and Step Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will show how to create a gym environment using [EAGERx](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/) while specifying the [step function](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/env/index.html#eagerx.core.env.EagerxEnv.step_fn) and [reset function](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/env/index.html#eagerx.core.env.EagerxEnv.reset_fn).\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this tutorial cover the following concepts of EAGERx:\n",
    "- Extracting observations in the [step_fn](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/env/index.html#eagerx.core.env.EagerxEnv.step_fn)\n",
    "- Resetting states using the [reset_fn](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/env/index.html#eagerx.core.env.EagerxEnv.reset_fn)\n",
    "- The `window` argument of the [connect method](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/graph/graph.html?highlight=connect#eagerx.core.graph.Graph.connect)\n",
    "- Simulating delays using the `delay` argument of the [connect method](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/graph/graph.html?highlight=connect#eagerx.core.graph.Graph.connect)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remainder of this tutorial we will go more into detail on these concepts.\n",

    "## Pendulum Swing-up\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create an environment for solving the classic control problem of swinging up an underactuated pendulum, very similar to the [Pendulum-v0 environment](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Pendulum-v0/).\n",
    "Our goal is to swing up this pendulum to the upright position and keep it there, while minimizing the velocity of the pendulum and the input voltage.\n",

    "Since the dynamics of a pendulum actuated by a DC motor are well known, we can simulate the pendulum by integrating the corresponding ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n",
    "\n",

    "$\\mathbf{x} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\theta \\\\ \\dot{\\theta} \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ \\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\dot{\\theta} \\\\ \\frac{1}{J}(\\frac{K}{R}u - mgl \\sin{\\theta} - b \\dot{\\theta} - \\frac{K^2}{R}\\dot{\\theta})\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\theta$ the angle w.r.t. upright position, $\\dot{\\theta}$ the angular velocity, $u$ the input voltage, $J$ the inertia, $m$ the mass, $g$ the gravitational constant, $l$ the length of the pendulum, $b$ the motor viscous friction constant, $K$ the motor constant and $R$ the electric resistance.\n",

    "This is in particular relevant when connecting to observations, since it has consequences for the size of the observation space.\n",
    "When connecting to an observation with `window` $= 0$, this observation will **not** be included in the observation space of the agent, because its dimensions might change every time step and are therefore unknown on beforehand.\n",
    "Also worth noting, is that for observations if `window` $= x > 1$, at time step $t < x$, the first message is repeated $x - t$ times to ensure that the dimensions of the observation space are consistent.\n",

    "Step-by-step we will guide you through the process of creating an environment for this scenario in the following assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you will need to modify or add some lines of code in the cells above.\n",

    "## 1. Violation of the Markov property\n",
    "\n",
    "We could naively remove the sensor *dtheta* in the environment above and train the agent.\n",
    "However, this will most likely not result in a successful policy because the [Markov property](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/3/node6.html) is violated.\n",
    "It is not possible to fully restore the Markov property without observing $\\dot{\\theta}$, but we can create a representation that is sufficient for solving the task.\n",
    "If we stack the last three measurements of $\\theta$ and provide this information as an observation, the agent will be able to approximate $\\dot{\\theta}$ (e.g. using a finite difference method).\n",
    "With this information, the agent can estimate the angular velocity at the previous time step.\n",
    "If we also provide the last applied action as an observation, the agent will be able to estimate $\\dot{\\theta}$ at the current time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the Markov property can also be violated due to delays.\n",
    "If we want our policy to transfer from simulation to a real system, we also need to account for delays that are present in the real world.\n",
    "Therefore we will simulate that the sensor *theta* has a delay of 0.01 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this the graph should look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figures/tutorial_21.svg\" width=720>\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have to update `step_fn`, since we no longer have the *angular_velocity* observation.\n",
    "In the reward function, we still want to penalize the angular velocity.\n",
    "Therefore we will have to approximate $\\dot{\\theta}$ in `step_fn`, which could for example be done as follows: $\\hat{\\dot{\\theta}} = \\text{rate} \\times (\\theta_k  - \\theta_{k - 1})$ where $k$ is the time step and rate is the `rate` of the [environment](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/env/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add your code to the following blocks: \n",
    "\n",
    "1.1 Remove sensor *dtheta* from and add sensor *u* to the list of sensors.  \n",
    "1.2 Connect sensor *theta* with `window` = 3 to stack the last three observations of $\\theta$ and set `delay` to 0.01.  \n",
    "1.3 Connect *u* to an observation called *action_applied* with `window` = 1.  \n",
    "1.4 Update the`step_fn` such that we use an estimate of $\\dot{\\theta}$ to calculate the reward.\n",
    "Hint: you could use the `previous_observation` for this.\n",

    "## 2. Initial state sampling and domain randomization\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will add domain randomization [domain randomization](https://sites.google.com/view/domainrandomization/), in order to improve the robustness against model inacurracies.\n",
    "If we want to transfer a policy from simulation to a real system, we need to be aware that the model used for simulation is inaccurate and that the agent could possibly exploit these inaccuracies.\n",
    "One of the techniques for addressing this problem is domain randomization, i.e. varying over simulator parameters in order to improve the robustness of the resulting policy.\n",
    "More specifically, we will do this by varying over the ODE parameters ($m, l, J, b, K$ and $R$).\n",
    "We can do this by adding the *model_parameters* state.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this the graph should look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also improve the reset procedure of the environment.\n",
    "At the beginning of each episode, the environment is reset.\n",
    "In the code as provided above, the pendulum is reset to the downward position with zero velocity each episode.\n",
    "However, the initial state distribution can have a significant influence on the learning speed.\n",
    "If we sample the $x_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ initial state every time, it will take many timesteps for the agent to obtain experience for $-\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n",
    "Namely, in the beginning the policy will be random and it is unlikely that acting randomly will result in the pendulum gaining enough momentum to move upwards.\n",
    "This is problematic, since the agent will obtain the highest rewards when the pendulum is pointed upwards.\n",
    "If the agent does not explore enough (see [the exploration-exploitation trade-off](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/2/node2.html)), the agent will not know that it can obtain the highest rewards by swinging the pendulum upward.\n",
    "Therefore, we will update the `reset_fn`, such that we sample the initial state randomly, rather than sampling $x_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ everytime.\n",
    "We also need to make sure that the aforementioned *model_parameters* state that is reset to perform domain randomization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add your code to the following blocks: \n",
    "\n",
    "2.1 Add the state *model_parameters* to the list of states of the pendulum  \n",
    "2.2 Update the reset function, such that the *model_state* and *model_parameters* states are reset to random values at the beginning of each episode."
