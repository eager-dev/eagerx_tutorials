    "# Tutorial 2: Reset and Step\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will show how to create a gym environment using [EAGERx](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/).\n",
    "Here we go a bit deeper into the [step()](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/env/index.html#eagerx.core.env.BaseEnv.step) and [reset()](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/env/index.html#eagerx.core.env.BaseEnv.reset) methods.\n",

    "The following will be covered:\n",

    "\n",
    "We will create an environment for solving the classic control problem of swinging up an underactuated pendulum, very similar to the [Pendulum-v1 environment](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/environments/classic_control/pendulum/).\n",
    "Our goal is to swing up this pendulum to the upright position and keep it there, while minimizing the velocity of the pendulum and the input voltage.\n",

    "## Let's get started\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we make the specification for a *Pendulum* object and add it to an empty graph, just like we did in the [first tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/eager-dev/eagerx_tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/pendulum/1_environment_creation.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will again connect the *u* actuator of the *Pendulum* to an action that we will call *voltage* and connect the sensors *theta* and *theta_dot* to observations, which we will call *angle* and *angular_velocity*.\n",
    "However, we will now go a bit more into detail on the [connect method](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/graph/graph.html?highlight=connect#eagerx.core.graph.Graph.connect).\n",
    "When connecting outputs, sensors or actions, we can specify among other things the `window` of the connection.\n",
    "It specifies how to deal with messages that are sent between nodes in between calls to their callback.\n",
    "In some cases it makes sense to use the last one only; in others you would like to receive all messages between calls.\n",
    "This can be achieved by setting the `window` size:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `window` $= 1$: Only the last received input message are available to the receiver.\n",
    "- `window` $= x \\ge 1$: The trailing last $x$ received input messages are available to the receiver ($1 \\le$ received number of messages $\\le$ `window` ).\n",
    "- `window` $= 0$: All input messages received since the last call to the node's callback are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is in particular relevant when connecting to observations, since it has consequences for the size of the observation space.\n",
    "When connecting to an observation with `window` $= 0$, this observation will **not by default** be included in the observation space of the agent, because its dimensions might change every time step and are therefore unknown beforehand. You can, however, always decide to add the observation manually to the space in the Gym environment definiton.\n",
    "Also worth noting, is that for observations with `window` $= x > 1$, at time step $t < x$, the first message is repeated $x - t$ times to ensure that the dimensions of the observation space is consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the `window` size, we can also specify a `delay` for each connection.\n",
    "In this way, we can easily simulate delays for inputs and sensors.\n"

    "It is not possible to fully restore the Markov property without observing $\\dot{\\theta}$, but we can create a representation that is sufficient for solving the task.\n",
    "If we stack the last three measurements of $\\theta$ and provide this information as an observation, the agent will be able to approximate $\\dot{\\theta}$ (e.g. using a finite difference method).\n",
    "With this information, the agent can estimate the angular velocity at the previous time step.\n",
    "If we also provide the last applied action as an observation, the agent will be able to estimate $\\dot{\\theta}$ at the current time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this the graph should look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figures/tutorial_21_gui.svg\" width=720>\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the Markov property can also be violated due to delays.\n",
    "If we want our policy to transfer from simulation to a real system, we also need to account for delays that are present in the real world.\n",
    "Therefore we will simulate that the sensor *theta* has a delay of 0.01 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have to update the `step()` method, since we no longer have the *angular_velocity* observation.\n",
    "In the reward function, we still want to penalize the angular velocity.\n",
    "Therefore we will have to approximate $\\dot{\\theta}$ in `step()`, which could for example be done as follows: $\\hat{\\dot{\\theta}} = \\text{rate} \\times (\\theta_k  - \\theta_{k - 1})$ where $k$ is the time step and rate is the `rate` of the [environment](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/env/index.html) in Hz.\n",

    "### Add your code to the following blocks: \n",
    "\n",
    "1.1 Remove sensor *theta_dot* from and add sensor *u_applied* to the list of sensors.  \n",
    "1.2 Remove the connection from sensor *theta_dot*.  \n",
    "1.3 Also, modify the connection with source *theta* and set `window` = 3 to stack the last three observations of $\\theta$ and set `delay` to 0.01.  \n",
    "1.4 Connect *u_applied* to an observation called *voltage_applied* with `window` = 1. Do you know why *u_applied* should be an observation to the agent in order to restore the Markov property?  \n",

    "## 2. Initial state sampling and domain randomization\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will add domain randomization [domain randomization](https://sites.google.com/view/domainrandomization/), in order to improve the robustness against model inacurracies.\n",
    "If we want to transfer a policy from simulation to a real system, we need to be aware that the model used for simulation is inaccurate and that the agent could possibly exploit these inaccuracies.\n",
    "One of the techniques for addressing this problem is domain randomization, i.e. varying over simulator parameters in order to improve the robustness of the resulting policy.\n",
    "More specifically, we will do this by varying over the ODE parameters ($m, l, J, b, K$ and $R$).\n",
    "We can do this by adding the *model_parameters* state.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this the graph should look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figures/tutorial_22_gui.svg\" width=720>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also improve the reset procedure of the environment.\n",
    "At the beginning of each episode, the environment is reset.\n",
    "In the code as provided above, the pendulum is reset to the downward position with zero velocity each episode.\n",
    "However, the initial state distribution can have a significant influence on the learning speed.\n",
    "If we sample the $\\mathbf{x}_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} \\pi \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ initial state every time, it will take many timesteps for the agent to obtain experience for $-\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n",
    "Namely, in the beginning the policy will be random and it is unlikely that acting randomly will result in the pendulum gaining enough momentum to move upwards.\n",
    "This is problematic, since the agent will obtain the highest rewards when the pendulum is pointed upwards.\n",
    "If the agent does not explore enough (see [the exploration-exploitation trade-off](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/2/node2.html)), the agent will not know that it can obtain the highest rewards by swinging the pendulum upward.\n",
    "Therefore, we will update the `reset()` method, such that we sample the initial state randomly, rather than sampling $\\mathbf{x}_0 = \\begin{bmatrix} \\pi \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ everytime.\n",
    "We also need to make sure that the aforementioned *model_parameters* state that is reset to perform domain randomization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add your code to the following blocks: \n",
    "\n",
    "2.1 Add the state *model_parameters* to the list of states of the pendulum.  Now,  both the `model_state` and `model_parameters` states are reset to random values at the beginning of each episode. This happens in the `env.reset()` function on line:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "states: Dict = self.state_space.sample()\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can also sample individual states from the environment's state space as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "state: np.ndarray = env.state_space[\"<object_name>/<state_name>\"].sample()\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `object_name` should be replaced with the name of the object (e.g. *pendulum*) and `state_name` with the name of the state (e.g. *model_parameters*).\n",

    "After implementing these modifications, the pendulum is still not swinging up... In the next tutorial you will find out why."
