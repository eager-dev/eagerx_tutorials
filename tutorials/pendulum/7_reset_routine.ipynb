    "\n",
    "Resetting an object to a desired state is non-trivial in the real-world compared to simulation, where resets can often be caried out with a single command. In this tutorial, we will discuss methods to include reset routines into your graph that can reset an object's state that work both in simulation and the real-world. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following will be covered:\n",
    "<!-- - Defining an object's state with an [`EngineState`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/engine_state/index.html).  -->\n",
    "- Defining the reset routine with a [`ResetNode`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html).\n",

In other words, the [`ResetNode`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html) will receive the desired state as a target and it will send actuator commands until the pendulum has reached this state.\n",

    "## How do [ResetNodes](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html) work?\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, resetting an object is non-trivial in the real-world compared to simulation, where resets can often be caried out with a single command. We developed [`ResetNodes`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html) in EAGERx to allow users to easily define reset routines that may, for example use pre-defined controllers, to reset an Object to a desired state. The structure of a [`ResetNode`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html) is very similar to a conventional [`Node`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/node.html). However, the [`callback()`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html#eagerx.core.entities.ResetNode.callback) of a [`ResetNode`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html) is skipped until the agent/user calls [`.reset()`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/env/index.html#eagerx.core.env.EagerxEnv.reset) on the gym evironment. At that moment, the desired state that that was selected in the [reset function](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/env/index.html#eagerx.core.env.EagerxEnv.reset_fn) (convered in [this tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/eager-dev/eagerx_tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/pendulum/2_reset_and_step.ipynb)) is send to the [`ResetNode`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html) as a `target` state. The [`ResetNode`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html) takes over control and starts sending commands to the object's actuators until the object's current state is equal (or close to) that target state. In other words, after the agent/user calls [`.reset()`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/env/index.html#eagerx.core.env.EagerxEnv.reset) the [`ResetNode.callback()`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html#eagerx.core.entities.ResetNode.callback) is called at the specified node `rate` with the connected `inputs` together with the `target` state and will produce `outputs` that bring the object's state closer to the desired state. During each callback, the [`ResetNode`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html) assess the status of the reset routine (i.e. whether the `target` state was reached) and communicates this status to the bridge with a message.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: To assure input-output synchronization in [`sync`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/bridge/index.html#eagerx.core.entities.Bridge.sync) mode, the [`ResetNode`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html) must be placed in-between the actions commanded by the agent/user and the object actuator. Over the course of an episode, the reset node simply feeds through all commands, and only after [`.reset()`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/env/index.html#eagerx.core.env.EagerxEnv.reset) is called, will the commands be produced by [`ResetNode.callback()`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html#eagerx.core.entities.ResetNode.callback). The reset node's `rate` is constrained to be equal to the rate of the commands that it must feedthrough. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How to define a [ResetNode](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html)?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a reset node by inheriting from the class [`ResetNode`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html).\n",
    "This class has the following abstract methods we need to implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`spec()`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html#eagerx.core.entities.ResetNode.spec): Specifies the parameters of the node.\n",
    "- [`initialize()`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html#eagerx.core.entities.ResetNode.initialize): Initializes the node.\n",
    "- [`reset()`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html#eagerx.core.entities.ResetNode.reset): Resets the node at the beginning of an episode.\n",
    "- [`callback()`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html#eagerx.core.entities.ResetNode.callback): Called at the rate of the node after the agent/user calls [`.reset()`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/env/index.html#eagerx.core.env.EagerxEnv.reset) on the gym evironment. It receives all connected `inputs` and `targets` as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## An example [ResetNode](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate how [`ResetNodes`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html) work, we will again create an environment with the *Pendulum* object, like we did in the [first](https://colab.research.google.com/github/eager-dev/eagerx_tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/pendulum/1_environment_creation.ipynb) and [second](https://colab.research.google.com/github/eager-dev/eagerx_tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/pendulum/2_reset_and_step.ipynb) tutorials. We will add a [`ResetNode`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html) called `angle_reset` and connect it as illustrated in the graph below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figures/tutorial_7_gui.svg\" width=720>\n",
    "\n",
    "- We connect the actions commanded by the agent (i.e. `voltage`) to the `feedthrough` connection `u` (light blue color) and we connect the `angle_reset`'s output `u` to the pendulum's actuator `u`. In this way, the `voltage` actions will be fed through to the output `u` during an episode, while the `angle_reset`'s [`callback()`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html#eagerx.core.entities.ResetNode.callback) will produce the outputs during a reset.\n",
    "- We connect the pendulum's `model_state` to the `angle_reset`'s target `goal`. In this way, the `angle_reset`'s [`callback()`](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/reset_node.html#eagerx.core.entities.ResetNode.callback) will receive the desired `model_state` as an argument.\n",
    "- To assess the status of the reset routine (i.e. whether the `model_state` state was reached, we connect the two pendulum sensors `theta` and `dtheta` as inputs to `angle_reset`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, the definition of this reset node is given. Currently, the node uses a [PID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) to reset the pendulum to a angle with zero angular velocity. If the reset takes too long, we timeout and consider the reset finished regardless of whether the target state was reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the exercise of this tutorial, we will modify this routine to, instead, apply random actions for a fixed amount of time (disregarding the desired state)."
