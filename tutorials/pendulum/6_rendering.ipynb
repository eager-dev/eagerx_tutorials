    "# Tutorial 6: More Informative Rendering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will discuss how to make rendering more informative. We will also demonstrate that rendering is agnostic to the selected physics-engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following will be covered:\n",
    "- Create an overlay node that augments a raw image sensors\n",
    "- Connect the overlay node and use it for rendering\n",
    "- Demonstrate that rendering is agnostic to the selected physics-engine\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remainder of this tutorial, we will go more into detail on this concept.\n",
