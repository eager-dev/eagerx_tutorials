    "In the preceding tutorials, we simulated the pendulum dynamics with a set of ordinary differential equations (ODE). In other words, the ODEs acted as the physics-engine. However, in robotics we are ultimately interested in how our learned controller performs in the real-world. EAGERx views the real-world as just another physics-engine. Ideally, we would only want to swap-out those components that are specific to the ODE physics-engine with the real-world specific components. In this way, all other (agnostic) components, such as controllers, are exactly the same in both setups, thus minimizing the differences between our real-world experiments and ODE simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In EAGERx, this is achieved by grouping the physics-engine specific components of an object into *engine-specific implementations*. The implementation is then registered to the engine that corresponds to the interfaced physics-engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, an object in EAGERx will have a **single** agnostic definition of the sensors, actuators, and states, but may have **multiple** *engine-specific implementations* for each physics-engine. This implementation then defines how the sensors, actuators, and states are simulated using a specified engine that, in turn, corresponds to a physics-engine (e.g. Pybullet, real-world, Gazebo, ...).\n",

This will add support for a physics-engine that is interfaced by the [GymEngine](https://github.com/eager-dev/eagerx/blob/master/eagerx/engines/openai_gym/engine.py). Basically, the physics-engine is the [Pendulum-v1](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/environments/classic_control/pendulum/) environment and it uses the dynamics of the [Pendulum-v1](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/environments/classic_control/pendulum/) environment to simulate our pendulum.\n",

    "In essence, an *engine-specific* implementation must do the following:\n",
    "- Set any engine-specific parameters that are required by the engine to add an object to the physics-engine. These correspond to the arguments (excluding `spec`) of the engine's [engine.add_object](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/engine/index.html#eagerx.core.entities.Engine.add_object) method. In the example below, we need to set the engine-specific parameter `env_id` to the id of the pendulum environment. You can get info on all the engine-parameters with `GymEngine.info(\"add_object\")` under the `add_object` section.\n",
    "- Make [EngineNodes](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/engine_node.html) and connect them in the [EngineGraph](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/graph/engine_graph.html) to the object's registered sensors and actuators. It is not compulsory to connect all registered sensors and actuators. Hence, you may only implement a subset of them. In this example, we do not connect the registered sensor `u_applied`, which is not a problem as long as we do not select it at run-time.\n",
    "- Make [EngineStates](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/engine_state/index.html) and set them to the object's registered states. In this example, we use dummy states, because OpenAI gym environments do not have a uniform API to set environment states. See the engine-implementation of the OdeEngine [here](https://github.com/eager-dev/eagerx_tutorials/blob/3ddc2eb7558c7825095611fec3a01a47f5e7af79/eagerx_tutorials/pendulum/objects.py#L108-L168) for a non-trivial example with engine states.\n"

Unfortunately, interactive notebooks do not allow us to easily demonstrate this without forcing users to have the exact same real pendulum we have in our lab. Therefore, we will instead add an implementation for the already defined OpenAI's [GymEngine](https://github.com/eager-dev/eagerx/blob/master/eagerx/engines/openai_gym/engine.py). We created [GymEngine](https://github.com/eager-dev/eagerx/blob/master/eagerx/engines/openai_gym/engine.py) so that any [OpenAI environment](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#classic_control) could be used as the physics-engine. In this exercise we will use the dynamics of the [Pendulum-v1](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Pendulum-v0/) environment to simulate our pendulum. For this, we will make use of the already defined engine nodes [here](https://github.com/eager-dev/eagerx/blob/master/eagerx/engines/openai_gym/enginenodes.py).\n",

    "Given that you've already created the engine nodes to interface the real pendulum, you can easily add an implementation for the [RealEngine](https://github.com/eager-dev/eagerx_reality/blob/m1aster/eagerx_reality/engine.py) to train with a real pendulum following the same steps. Creating [engine nodes](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/engine_node.html) is very similar to creating regular nodes which was already covered in [tutorial 4](https://colab.research.google.com/github/eager-dev/eagerx_tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/pendulum/4_nodes.ipynb). \n",

    "### Add your code to the following blocks: \n",
    "\n",
    "1.1.a Make an EngineNode `FloatOutput` that will be used to simulated `dtheta`. Use `idx=1` as an argument, because the angular velocity is the second entry in the processed observation array (ie `angular_velocity = obs[1]`, hence `idx=1`).\n",
    "*(hint: look at the code for `theta`).*  \n",
    "1.1.b Add EngineNode `dtheta` to the engine graph. *(hint: look at the code for `theta`).*  \n",
    "1.1.c Connect `dtheta` to the corresponding sensor with `sensor=dtheta`. *(hint: look at the code for `theta`).*  \n",
    "\n",
    "1.2 Select the GymEngine by uncommenting the marked line. Run the code *(note: you may need to restart your kernel)*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1.3.a Now, select sensor `u_applied` (not to be mistaken with the actuator `u`!!) for the pendulum.  \n",
    "1.3.b Connect it as an `observation`.\n",
    "Run the code and observe that it fails.\n",
    "As the error states, we did not provide an implementation for sensor `u_applied`.\n",
    "This highlights that it is not compulsory to implement every actuator, sensor, or state that was defined by the object.\n",
    "You are free to only support a subset of them. However, you **will** get an error if you try to run with one that does not have an *engine-specific* implementation for the selected engine.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1.4 Switch back to using the OdeEngine (while still selecting sensor `u_applied`).\n",
    "Run the code.\n",
    "It should again run without problems, as the OdeEngine **does** have an implementation for the sensor `u_applied`."
