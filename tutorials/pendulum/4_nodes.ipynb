    "In other words, if we were to cut the graph at each object, the graph should be a Directed Acyclical Graph ([DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)).\n",

    "1.3 During a reset at the beginning of the episode, we should make sure that the moving average is reset to 0.\n",
    "So, make sure that the instance variable *moving_average* you have just created is reset to 0 in [reset()](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/node.html#eagerx.core.entities.Node.reset).\n",
    "1.4 In [callback()](https://eagerx.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/api_reference/node/node.html#eagerx.core.entities.Node.callback), the actual moving average should be calculated.\n",
    "Calculate the moving average recursively, i.e. $a_t = \\frac{(n-1)a_{t-1} + x_t}{n}$, where $a_t$ is the moving average at time step $t$, $n$ is the moving average window size and $x_t$ the value of the input *signal* at time step $t$.\n",

    "<img src=\"./figures/tutorial_42_communication_graph.svg\" width=420>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see that this results in a causal loop between *actions/voltage*, *filter/filtered* and *observations*.\n",

    "### Add your code to the following blocks: \n",
    "\n",
    "2.1 Connect the output *filtered* of the node *filter* to an observation called *moving_average* in order to restore the Markov property.\n",
